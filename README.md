###Lightening Network Faucet

Lightening Network Faucet is a simple faucet for both Bitcoin and Litecoin testnets that operates on lightening network.
 It sends crypto to the user by opening a payment channel instead of using on-chain mechanism. It also maintains channels
 to various other applications built on top of lightening networks like `HTLC.me`, `Y'alls`, `LNCast`, `starblock`, `Blockstream Store`
 etc and allows you to transact with them directly, without opening a channel with them separately.
